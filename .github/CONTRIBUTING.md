### Contribute code

We recommend that you first [create an issue](https://github.com/studiopress/pattern-manager/issues/new) to propose and discuss major changes before working on them.

[Fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) the [Pattern Manager repository](https://github.com/studiopress/pattern-manager) to your own GitHub account, then clone it to work on locally:

    git clone git@github.com:you-username/pattern-manager.git

Create a new branch to work on your changes. New branches should be forked from the `main` branch.

Make your changes and commit your code.

When you're ready, [create a pull request](https://github.com/studiopress/pattern-manager/pulls) to outline and contribute your changes.

To increase the chance that your pull request is approved:

* Lint your code to check that it conforms to WordPress standards. Learn more about the [developer tooling to help lint your code](https://github.com/studiopress/pattern-manager/wiki/For-Developers#linting-code).
* In commit messages or pull request text, always clearly describe the problems your code solves or the improvements it brings.
